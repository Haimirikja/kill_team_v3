                    <li>Determine one shared crit op and set up objective markers. Other than in Killzone: Bheta-Decima, all objective markers must be set up on the killzone floor.</li>

                    <li>The player with initiative selects one drop zone. Their opponent has the other drop zone and gains the Re-roll initiative card (explained in step 4).</li>

                    <li>Each player secretly selects up to four equipment options. Each option cannot be selected more than once per player. They then reveal their selections simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>Each player starts with 2CP.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Each player alternates setting up an item of equipment that's set up before the battle (ladders, etc.), starting with the player with initiative. Note: it's item by item, not option by option.</li>
                    <li>Each player alternates setting up one third of their kill team (rounding up), starting with the player with initiative. When a player sets up an operative, it must be wholly within their drop zone and must be given a Conceal order.</li>

                <h2>Play the battle</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>To determine initiative during each turning point (including the first), the players roll off (ties are not re-rolled). Starting with the player that lost the roll-off, each player alternates either using an initiative card to alter the result of their roll or passing, until they both pass in succession.</li>
                    <li>If player(s) would use their kill team rules to affect the roll-off, they must do so before playing initiative cards, starting with the player that's losing the roll-off.</li>
                    <li>The Re-roll initiative card allows the player to re-roll their initiative roll. The remaining initiative cards all change the player's roll result up or down (this can take it above 6 or below 1).</li>
                    <li>The winner of the roll-off decides who has initiative. Except during the fourth turning point, the loser of the roll-off gains an initiative card with a value equal to the turning point. If the roll-off is a tie, the player that didn't have initiative at that time is the winner.</li>
                    <li>As a Strategic Gambit during the first turning point, each player secretly selects one of their three operations (critical, elimination or tactical) as their primary operation. Then, each player places a card with their choice face down, or uses a die or other method to indicate it.</li>
                    <li>Each player can score a maximum of 6VP for each operation.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The battle ends after four turning points have been completed. If a player has no operatives in the killzone but the battle has not ended, the other player completes the remaining turning points until the battle ends.</li>
                    <li>At the end of the battle, all players simultaneously reveal their primary operations. They score additional VP equal to half what they scored for that operation (rounding up).</li>
                    <li>The player with the most VP is the winner. If players are tied, the battle is a draw.</li>
